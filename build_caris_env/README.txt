nbspython.bat must be run with conda in the path.  For example, cd to the 
C:\PydroXL\Scripts directory and run the bat from from that location.  A conda
environment will be created for that conda installation.

To add the CARIS python API place the accompanying nbs.pth file to this file
into the PydroXL\envs\NBS35\Lib\site-packages directory before activating the
environment.
