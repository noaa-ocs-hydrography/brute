NOTE: Because of the nature of testing, some of the Version 1.2 pickle files
may actually be Version 1.3 files.  This is usually not an issue due to Version
1.3 having additional attribute fields, not less.

Version 1.2 - The initial testing version in which collecting attributes of the
eHydro_query took place.

Version 1.3 - First 'stable' version of the eHydro scrape attributes
