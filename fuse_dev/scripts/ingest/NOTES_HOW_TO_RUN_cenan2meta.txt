How to run example file:
open pyton 3.6.7 command window from pydro (it uses several libraries for interpolation that Casiano is working on for natural neighbors interpolation)
Nex one needs to call the script from within the path:fuse_dev\scripts\ingest
#It needs to be within here in order to see the config file. otherwise one needs to have a relative path from whatever the starting directory is ../../.. /fuse_dev\scripts\ingest
Ex: cd C:\NBS_GIT\fuse_dev\scripts\ingest
python "C:\NBS_GIT\fuse_dev\scripts\ingest\cesam2meta.py"
