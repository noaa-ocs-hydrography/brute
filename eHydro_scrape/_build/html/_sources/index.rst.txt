eHydro_scrape Module
--------------------

eHydro_scrape.lnk Assumptions
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The shortcut link ``eHydro_srape.lnk`` provided with the distribution to run the script makes
several assumptions:

1. The user's command prompt is located in ``C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe``
2. The user has Pydro installed in ``C:\\PydroXL``

Configuring an Individual Query
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The configuration file ``config.ini`` provided with the distribution allows
users to modify the query run by the script.  As a script geared towards
automation, the ``config.ini`` maintains a 'set and forget' fucntionality.
However, if a user wishes to modifiy the file for specific queries, there are
plenty of options avaiable:

1. **[Timeframe]**
    - Dates are formated ``YYYY-MM-DD``
    - Start Date and End Date are used to define custom date ranges for a query. If these fields are left blank, the default values are ``Yesterday`` and ``Today`` as defined in :func:`eHydro_scrape.query`
    - If Ignore Date is set to ``yes``, both the default values and values entered in the Start Date and End Date fields are ignored and the script will query the entirety of eHydro (barring additional modifications in a seperate section)
2. **[Agencies]**
    - Agencies: List of agencies to focus on listed in CAPS and seperated by commas (ex. CEMVN, CENWP)
        - Surveys from agencies listed here that do not contain ``_A.xyz`` or ``_FULL.xyz`` will be deleted unless **[Resolutions]** Override is set to ``yes``
    - Only Listed: Default is ``no``
        - ``no``: Will query from all avaiable agencies
        - ``yes``: Will only query from the listed agencies
3. **[Resolutions]**
    - Override: Default is ``no``
        - ``no``: The tool will delete the files for non high-res data from queries
        - ``yes``: Overrides deletion of non high-res data from queries
4. **[Data Checking]**
    - Override: Default is ``no``; This option may be used if you wish to compile the complete results from a specific query
        - ``no``: The program will check against the master list of past surveys and remove items that have already been checked in the past
        - ``yes``: Overrides the deletion of previously checked surveys.  These results are saved to the :attr:`eHydro_scrape.running` folder
5. **[Output Log]**
    - Query List: Default is ``yes``; Choice of full query results or only program steps
        - ``yes``: will list basic details for every survey object found, including if Hi-Res data is found
        - ``no``: will not list any basic details for the surveys found and only list the number of Hi-Res surveys found in the query
    - Log Type: Default is ``False``; Choice of the default continuous log file or a individual log file for the run
        - ``False``: will update the continuous log file
        - ``True``: will create a seperate log file in the :attr:`eHydro_scrape.logging` folder
